## General info
I designed a website in this project. This website allows registered users to create their own todo lists.
When you first open the site, a login form appears.
If you are not a registered to the site, you can sign up from the link at the bottom of the form or from the register section at the top right.
When registering, users are forced to use a unique username.
The two passwords entered while registering on the site must be the same.
After you have registered and logged in, you will see a list and a form that allows you to add a task to this list.
After starting to add tasks to the list, select all and mark as done buttons become active.
When you select the task from the list and click the mark as done button, the tasks and date you selected are added to your done list.
You can select and remove the tasks you want to remove from the list in the remove section at the top right.
When you click on the top right part, the tasks you have completed and their completion dates are listed.
Unwanted tasks can be removed from this list.
